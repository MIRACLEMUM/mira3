                <h2>MIRACLE SUNDAY</h2>
                <P>I am a passionate and creative individual with a knack for web design,
                    development, and innovation. With experience working on various projects,
                    including websites for e-commerce, skincare, and churches,
                    I take pride in creating functional and visually appealing digital experiences.
                    I recently ventured into JavaScript, 
                    expanding my skills to enhance interactivity and dynamic features in web applications.
                     My journey in web development is fueled by a strong commitment to continuous learning and excellence.
                     Outside of coding, I have a keen interest in designing with impactful aesthetics
                     , whether for luxurious brands like perfumes or responsive platforms that resonate with diverse audiences.
                      I am detail-oriented, enjoy solving challenges, and always seek to make a difference through my work.
